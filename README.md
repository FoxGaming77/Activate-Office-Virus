Hi, This is 1.0 of Office Virus and It basicly if you look at the source code there is restart.bat and Part2.vbs so restart.bat copys Part2.vbs to your Startup folder in windows then it restarts the system and once does that a message box will appear and it will say "Sorry Office couldent activate. Please try again" and thats it i will be updating it every day.
